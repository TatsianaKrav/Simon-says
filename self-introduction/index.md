[My presentation](https://youtu.be/QDUkf4GtvtI)

My name is Tatiana, I’m a french interpreter (with English as a second language), I graduated  from Minsk Linguistic University and the majority of my professional experience I’ve worked within my speciality. But all this time I was thinking about changing my job because I’d like to find myself in a career. I wish to be passionate about my job, to develop my knowledge in my profession. 

The IT sphere became very popular and I believe that it’s just what I need to try. I participated in different open days and workshops from IT schools, I even started to read some JS and Java manuals but self education was difficult for me, especially during my maternity leave.

Fortunately, in 2021 I had the chance to participate in the program "Gender equality of women in IT" from IBM institute of Minsk. Within this program I took the course of programming basics in Java. Trying to find myself in the IT sphere, I realized that frontend development  is what really attracts me. I fancy seeing the result of my work on the browser page immediately . It also has a creative part - I mean site layouts. In October 2022 I started Frontend  courses in ITlogia school which I successfully completed in October 2023.

Within the course: 
I  made different  layout pages using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- I gained knowledge about preprocessors such as LESS, SASS, task runners Gulp, Grunt, Webpack
- as well as about jQuery and TypeScript
- I created several projects in vanilla JS
- I learnt the basics of the Angular framework, the general concepts of writing tests  and  working with backend and http requests.

I completed up to 10 cases (including landing pages and projects on Angular).

Just after the end of these courses I started my way in RSSchool and I believe it’s an amazing opportunity to apply my knowledge into practice and to bridge the skills gap.
It’s my second try in this school and I hope I will succeed this year.

I feel JS is what I'm ready to spend hours on and I feel pleasant about it. I have the intention to continue my growth in JS and I hope that  it will be successful.
